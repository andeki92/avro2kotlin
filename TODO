add converters to generated kotlin enum
serde, hiding the java type

support arrays
support maps
support other innerTypes
recursive innerTypes
support multiple non-null innerTypes in a union (prob convert to Any/Any?)

remove the avro-maven-plugin source from my codebase - use it as a dependency instead
make the output classes easy to read and understand: hide converter methods in a factory

get the integration tests to run without a real kafka broker

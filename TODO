get rid avro folder with example schemas from avro-kotlin-compiler module

make the smoke test 3 real tests
support enums (needed to be useful for cleanser)
support arrays
support maps
support other innerTypes

one kotlin file per protocol
recursive innerTypes
support multiple non-null innerTypes in a union (prob convert to Any/Any?)
serde, hiding the avro type

remove the avro-maven-plugin source from my codebase - use it as a dependency instead
make the output classes easy to read and understand: hide converter methods in a factory

get the tests to run without a real kafka broker
standalone converter tool: configure which directory you send it to

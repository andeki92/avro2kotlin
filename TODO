generate the java code along with the kotlin code to the current directory
work out the output filename
configure which directory you send it to
make it a maven plugin: get the two plugins to play nicely together (or maybe do the avro conversion myself)

support enums (needed to be useful for cleanser)
support arrays
support maps
support other innerTypes

one kotlin file per protocol
recursive innerTypes
support multiple non-null innerTypes in a union (prob convert to Any/Any?)
serde, hiding the avro type
